### Using the interface

Django Verifications provides templates and views for an interface, allowing you to easily verify all of the fields
on any objects in your database, and make corrections to those values as needed. To access the interface,
you just need to import the URLs specified in `django_verifications.urls` and navigate to the Django Verifications
home page.
